A personal collection of Bash scripts for Personal, Server and Cloud Tasks.
I will pre-face that these scripts are primarily written for debian environments.

## Highlights

1. [master_dependencies_install](scripts/dependencies/master_dependency_install) : Install all the necessary dependencies to run scripts in each category
2. [heic_to_jpg](scripts/utilities/heic_to_jpg) : Use imagemagick to convert all .heic files in a folder to jpg

## Utility

1. [utility_dependencies_install](scripts/dependencies/utility_dependencies_install) : Install the dependencies for running scripts in the Utility category
2. [heic_to_jpg](scripts/utilities/heic_to_jpg) : Use [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) to convert all .heic files in a folder to jpg
3. [format_to_format](scripts/utilities/format_to_format) : Use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to change from one video format to another
